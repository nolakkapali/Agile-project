### Agile Process
***
<b>Step 1:</b> Requirments are collected and Product Backlog is designed. <br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Sprint Backlog is designed and Sprint Cycle starts. <br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Each sprint cycle some parts of the application is developed and tested and after end of each sprint, a version of the web application is released.<br>

### Developing and Testing 
***
The whole application is divided into 4 modules.They are:
<ol><li>Home</li>
<li>Course Admission</li>
<li>QA Services</li>
<li>Contact Us</li></ol>
After each module is developed,software testing is performed on each module. Multiple types of software testing are performed on those modules. They are given below:<br><br>
<ul><li><b>Smoke and Sanity Testing:</b> Smoke and Sanity tests both checks the basic functionality of the application.After getting first unstable software build, smoke testing is performed based on the smoke test cases and when the build gets stable,sanity testing is performed.</li>
<li><b>Functional Testing:</b> After passing the smoke test or sanity test, functional testing is performed on the build based on the functional test cases.</li>
<li><b>Cross-Browser Testing:</b> Cross-Browser testing is performed on each module for multiple browsers such as Google Chrome,Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge based on the test cases</li>
<li><b>Retesting:</b> Retesting is performed in the failed test cases to verify the bug fix.</li>
<li><b>Full Regression Testing:</b> Full regression testing is performed to validate the modules functionality. After all the testing is done, a final full regression testing is performed for each releases to check if there are any bugs left on the module.</li>
</ul>
